#Level2 / Task2 - Number_Guesser
#Here user have to guess a random number generated by the program
#The random number is between 1 and 1000
#But to make it easy the program also generates a random range 
#The random range is of specified span of 50 digits
#I have created this program using python in Pycharm IDE
